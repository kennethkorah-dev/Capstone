# Capstone
This project is a power system fault detection algorithm implemented on a WSCC 9-bus test system. The system was modelled in SIMULINK, where Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) were used to extract system data. The data was then processed in a MATLAB script to detect fault zones and fault lines.
