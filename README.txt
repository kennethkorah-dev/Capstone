**Power System Fault Detection using Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) Data**

1. Project Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is a power system fault detection algorithm implemented on a WSCC 9-bus test system. The system was modelled in SIMULINK, where Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) were used to extract system data. The data was then processed in a MATLAB script to detect fault zones and fault lines.

2. Repository
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code and documentation for this project can be found on GitHub at the following link: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kennethkorah-dev/Capstone/tree/main)

3. Installation and Setup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	a. Prerequisites
	Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

	- MATLAB (recommended version: R2023a or later)
	- SIMULINK (compatible with your MATLAB version)
	- Control System Toolbox
	- Signal Processing Toolbox


	b. Installation Steps
	i. Download the Project: 
	First, download the project files from the GitHub repository. You can do this by clicking on the repository link and selecting the option to download the files as a ZIP archive. Extract the files to a location on your computer.

	ii. Open MATLAB:
	Launch MATLAB on your computer.

	iii. Navigate to the Project Folder: 
	Use MATLAB's file browser or the command window to navigate to the folder where you extracted the project files.

	iv. Open the SIMULINK Model:
	Locate the SIMULINK model file 'Test_9_bus_system.slx' and open it within MATLAB.

	v. Run the Simulation:
	Execute the simulation within SIMULINK to generate data from the Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs).

	vi. Run the Fault Detection Script:
	Once the simulation is complete, run the MATLAB script 'FDLA.m' designed for fault detection. This script processes the data generated by the simulation to identify and display fault zones and lines.


4. Usage
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- The SIMULINK model simulates the WSCC 9-bus system and collects data through the PMUs.
	- The MATLAB script processes the data to detect faults and identifies the fault zones and lines.
	- Results are displayed in the MATLAB Command Window.


5. Documentation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- A detailed user manual is provided in the `Documentation` folder. The manual explains the system setup, fault detection algorithm, and usage instructions.
